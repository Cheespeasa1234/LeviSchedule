## Getting Started

Welcome to the LeviSchedule Program. Here is a guideline to help you get started to make your schedules in LeviSchedule.
In /schedules, open classes.scopt . Then, replace each class name with your real class names, from first period to last period. Add in a RGBA color code for that class, if you wish to change it.
Then, to set your schedules for each day, go to /schedules/default/mon.sched . You can change timestamps or add your own, and either add in a new event or remove one.
